# vanilla

Vanilla is a simple Weather Bot that runs in Terminal. It was developed using Node.js and Yahoo's Weather API.
I used YQL, Yahoo's Structured Query Language to retrieve geolocation data, and find each place's "Where on Earth ID" to get details weather such as weather and temperature.

I used Nodemon for running the bot, and used XRegExp to get patterns in the user's input string by converting the string to Regular Expressions.

Steps to run the bot:

1. Download the Zip File and Extract.


2. Open the folder and start "Terminal".


3. Install the following:

   npm install nodemon
   
   npm install xregexp
   
   npm install yql
   
   
4. Run the bot:
  
   nodemon app.js
